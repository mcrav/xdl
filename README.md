# XDL

XDL is a chemical description language for representing chemical procedures in a machine and human-readable way. This package provides an abstract framework for linking this representation to execution on automated synthesis platforms.

## Installation

```
pip install xdl
```

## Usage

This is a basic usage example. For more detailed usage instructions, see [the documentation](https://croningroup.gitlab.io/chemputer/xdl).

```python
from xdl import XDL

# Load XDL procedure
x = XDL('procedure.xdl')

# Compile XDL procedure to run on specific platform graph
x.prepare_for_execution('procedure_graph.json')

# This line depends which platform you are doing so is just written here as pseudocode.
platform_controller = instantiate_platform_controller(**params)

# Execute XDL procedure on automated platform
x.execute(platform_controller)
```
