# XDL Interpreter

## Project Roadmap

### Dangerous reagent combinations (ChemBrain)

1. Create system where generics such as alcohol can be used instead of listing the CAS of every alcohol.
2. Create record of dangerous reagent combinations.

### Waste

1. Create database of where different reagents should be added to waste.
2. Ask user if unsure where to waste reagent.
3. Prompt user if insufficient waste vessels available in graphML

### Documentation

1. Formal XDL documentation
2. Formal GraphML documentation

### Close Open Commands

1. Make system more intelligent. Close command when reactor is empty.

### Decide on concrete namespace

### Syntax Validation

1. Complete list of compulsory attributes and make test files.
2. Test in MakeSolution length of solute_mass matches length of solute attribute.

### Unit Testing

1. Hardware mapping
2. Waste mapping
