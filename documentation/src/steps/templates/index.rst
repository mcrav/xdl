xdl.steps.templates
===================

The templates here define the XDL cross platform standard. The purpose of this
is to provide a minimum parameter set that step implementations must conform to.
Extra parameters can be added for specific platforms if desired, but the minimum
parameter set means that a XDL file written according to the standard should be
interoperable between different platforms.
