Generating XDL file
==============

XDL files can be written manually, but the easiest way to produce them is from
written procedures using `SynthReader <http://chemify.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/synthreader>`_.

If the XDL produced by `SynthReader <http://chemify.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/synthreader>`_
is not correct, the written procedure can be altered to aid translation, for example,
by converting present tense to past tense, and removing unnecessary detail.
